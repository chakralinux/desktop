How to prepare the kde PKGBUILD, this is valid for plasma and kde applications
>> Modify the file kdeapps.conf for applications and plasma.conf for plasma and change the release numbers
>> based on the release add/remove the list of packages to be build. Remeber to keep the right order!

## define the right group ##
groups=('kde' 'kde-uninstall' 'kde-applications' 'kdegraphics')

for applications alwasy include:
  'kde' 'kde-applications'
for plasma always include:
  'plasma'

## replacements ##
replaces=('kdegraphics-gwenview')
conflicts=('kdegraphics-gwenview')

## source lines ##
with this lines the packages are properly downloaded or loaded from the _source folder in the build root

source=("$_mirror/${pkgname}-$_kdever.tar.xz")
sha256sums=(`grep ${pkgname}-$_kdever.tar.xz  ../checksums.txt | cut -d " " -f1`)


Sample structure:

prepare() {
  mkdir -p build
}

build() {
  cd build
  cmake_kf5 ../${pkgname}-${pkgver}
  make
}

package() {
  cd build
  make DESTDIR="${pkgdir}" install
}
