# List of maps with package operations such as install or remove.
# Distro developers can provide a list of packages to remove
# from the installed system (for instance packages meant only
# for the live system).
#
# A job implementing a distro specific logic to determine other
# packages that need to be installed or removed can run before
# this one. Distro developers may want to install locale packages
# or remove drivers not needed on the installed system.
# This job will populate a list of dictionaries in the global
# storage called "packageOperations" and it is processed
# after the static list in the job configuration.
