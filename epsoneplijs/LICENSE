=======
  The ijs-derived part follows the same licence as ijs. The rest of the code 
  is under the GNU public license, except "epl_compress.c".

  As of version 0.2.3, the usb branch has merged back to the main branch,
  and we no longer bundle libusb as a sub-directory within the source bundle. 
  The src rpm still includes a libusb tar ball and recreates a sub-directory 
  during rpm building, for convenience.

  The content of "epl_compress.c" may have issues with Epson which we are 
  not yet sure about. Therefore we hereby explicitly ask whoever uses the 
  content of that file, NOT to use it for any purpose other than in relation  
  to the Epson EPL series of printers.
