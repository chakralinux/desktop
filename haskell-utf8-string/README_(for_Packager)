When you update Haskell packages you'll have to update the entire stack to not break it.

To help you I wrote a simple guide step-by-step.

## NOTE: it's possible that some new haskell-package has been added to our repository, so before you update the entire stack you need to check it and then proceed


> First you have to update these packaes:

haskell-binary
haskell-bytestring-show
haskell-dataenc
haskell-deepseq
haskell-extensible-exceptions
haskell-html
haskell-mmap
haskell-primitive
haskell-random
haskell-syb
haskell-stm
haskell-terminfo
haskell-transformers
haskell-mtl
haskell-utf8-string
haskell-zlib
haskell-tar

> Then update one-by-one the following packages:

haskell-text

haskell-parsec

haskell-network

haskell-http

haskell-hslogger

haskell-vector

haskell-regex-base

haskell-regex-posix

haskell-regex-compat

haskell-hashed-storage

haskell-haskeline


> ...lastly you have to update this:

haskell-cabal-install
